# Abusive-Text-Detection-using-Advance-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on  developing an effective solution for detecting and blocking hate-speech content from social media.  This project uses advanced machine learning techniques to scan and identify hate  speech, and insulting comments from social media posts. 
The system incorporates natural language processing methodologies to address the complexity of language patterns and context in social media text. The deployment stage was the process of collecting and preprocessing a diverse dataset from social media sites and then optimizing the model for high accuracy and low latency. 
In the first phase, we have tested several algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and more complex deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The best model has superior performance with high precision and recall scores.  
In the second phase, the trained model will be implemented as a Chrome extension to identify hate speech. The extension will act as a browser-level filter so that end-users can moderate their social media activity and create a safer online environment. The extension is using a light architecture to ensure seamless integration and low computational overhead on end-users.
